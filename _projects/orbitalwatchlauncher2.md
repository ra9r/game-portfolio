OWL2 (Orbital Watch Launcher 2) is a 1-bit missile-defense arcade game for Playdate focused on
tight feedback loops, legible visuals, and satisfying chain reactions.

## Responsibilities

- Designed the core loop around scarce ammo and bonus shots
- Implemented gameplay and UI in Lua with a custom level system
- Iterated heavily based on live playtest sessions

## Design Notes

- Strong emphasis on clarity on the Playdate’s small screen
- Inverted-color mode for outdoor visibility
- Difficulty ramps through missile speed, count, and pattern variety

## Learnings

- How small changes in timing can dramatically affect perceived difficulty
- The importance of testing on real hardware rather than just the simulator
