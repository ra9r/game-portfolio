I’m Rodney Aiglstorfer, a game designer and developer currently focused on systems-driven gameplay,
prototyping, and small-team production.

I enjoy taking ideas from *“wouldn’t it be cool if…”* through to working builds, and I tend to bounce
between code, design docs, and playtests. Recent work includes Playdate titles, Unreal escape-room
experiences, and tools-oriented projects like virtual tabletops and learning games.

When I’m not building games I’m usually thinking about how to make game dev workflows smoother,
how to teach complex topics through play, or how to ship more experiments.
